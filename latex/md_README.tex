\section*{G\-L\-T Release 2.\-5 }

G\-L\-T is a common A\-P\-I for H\-P\-C lightweight thread (L\-W\-T) libraries. It supports Massive\-Threads, Qthreads, and Argobots as underlying L\-W\-T solutions. Moreover, G\-L\-T over Pthread is implemented with comparative purpose.

In addition, G\-L\-T can be used as P\-O\-S\-I\-X threads A\-P\-I since version 2.\-5.

\section*{1. Getting Started }

The following instructions take you through a sequence of steps to get G\-L\-T installed and compiled.

(a.\-1) You will need the following prerequisites. \begin{DoxyVerb}- REQUIRED: This tar file GLT-2.5.tar.gz

- REQUIRED: A C compiler (gcc is sufficient)
\end{DoxyVerb}


(a.\-2) At least one of these libraries\-: \begin{DoxyVerb}- Argobots library.

- Qthreads library.

- MassiveThreads library.
\end{DoxyVerb}


(b) Unpack the tar file and go to the top level directory\-: \begin{DoxyVerb}  tar xzf GLT-2.5.tar.gz
  cd GLT 
\end{DoxyVerb}


If your tar doesn't accept the z option, use \begin{DoxyVerb}  gunzip GLT-2.5.tar.gz
  tar xf GLT-2.5.tar
  cd GLT
\end{DoxyVerb}


(c) Define environment variables\-: \begin{DoxyVerb}The definition of the HOME_ARG, HOME_QTH, and HOME_MTH environment 
variables with the path to Argobots, Qthreads, and MassiveThreads 
libraries respectively is required.
\end{DoxyVerb}


(d) Build G\-L\-T\-: \begin{DoxyVerb}cd src

for csh and tcsh:

  make [arg|qth|mth|pth] |& tee m.txt

for bash and sh:

  make [arg|qth|mth|pth] 2>&1 | tee m.txt
\end{DoxyVerb}






\section*{2. How to use G\-L\-T }

I. G\-L\-T offers two library approaches\-:

(a) Dynamic library. Once the step 1 is completed, a libglt.\-so file can be found in each underlying library folder. The glt.\-h file needs to be included in the user's code and the -\/lglt flag added to the compilation order.

(d) Static library. In order to use this performance-\/oriented implementation fast\-\_\-glt.\-h file may be included in the user's code and the -\/\-D\-F\-A\-S\-T\-G\-L\-T flag added to the compilation order.

I\-I. Using Pthreads A\-P\-I with G\-L\-T

G\-L\-T also offers the use of code written with pthreads just including \char`\"{}glt\-\_\-pthreads.\-h\char`\"{} instead of \char`\"{}pthread.\-h\char`\"{}
